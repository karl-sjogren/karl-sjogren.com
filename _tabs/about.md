I'm a software developer from Ume√•, Sweden that has been building websites since
the late 1990s.

I've been programming in .NET since version 1.1, I jumped on the .NET Core
bandwagon while it was still called DNX so naturally most code I write is for
the .NET platform. I'm also a huge fan of writing frontend code using vanilla
javascript to create good progressively enhanced solutions without depending
on server side rendering or such.

While I write code for a living I also tend to do a lot of stuff in my spare time,
which I almost always publish to [Github](https://github.com/karl-sjogren/).

When I have the time I also like to answer questions on
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/547640/karl-johan-sj%c3%b6gren)
though as most people I do read and learn a lot more then I contribute.
